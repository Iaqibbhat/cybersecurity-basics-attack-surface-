# Understanding Cybersecurity Basics and Attack Surface

## Introduction
This repository explains the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity and the concept of attack surface in a clear and beginner-friendly manner.

## Cybersecurity Basics
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and data from cyber threats.
It aims to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions.

### CIA Triad
Cybersecurity is based on three core principles:
- Confidentiality – Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users
- Integrity – Ensuring data is accurate and not altered without permission
- Availability – Ensuring systems and data are accessible when required

## Attack Surface
An attack surface refers to all possible entry points where an attacker could attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in a system.

### Types of Attack Surface
- Network Attack Surface (open ports, IP addresses, servers)
- Application Attack Surface (web apps, APIs, login forms)
- Physical Attack Surface (USB ports, devices, servers)
- Human Attack Surface (phishing, weak passwords, social engineering)

## Reducing Attack Surface
Attack surface can be reduced by disabling unused services, applying security updates, using strong authentication mechanisms, and conducting security awareness training.
